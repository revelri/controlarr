MCP server that connects AI assistants to your [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) media server — 31 tools, 13 live resources, and 18 guided workflows. Search your library, control playback, manage metadata, find subtitles, troubleshoot your server, and more.

**[Setup](#setup)** · **[Transport](#transport)** · **[Options](#options)** · **[MCP capabilities](#mcp-capabilities)** · **[Important notes](#important-notes)**

## What can it do?

- **Find and play media** — search your library and start playback on any connected client
- **Browse and filter** — by genre, year, studio, actor, rating, played status, and more
- **Recommendations** — personalized suggestions from your own library, not external sites
- **Control playback** — play, pause, seek, stop, volume, next/previous on any device
- **Playlists and collections** — create, manage, deduplicate playlists and box set collections
- **Music** — browse artists, albums, genres; generate instant mix playlists
- **Subtitles** — search, download, and audit missing subtitles across your library
- **Metadata management** — fix titles, genres, ratings, images; batch updates; re-identify items
- **Troubleshoot your server** — read server logs, check failed tasks, diagnose playback issues
- **Server admin** — user management, library scans, scheduled tasks, plugins, devices, backups
- **Analytics** — watch history, codec reports, duplicate detection, library stats
- **Live TV and DVR** — guide data, channels, recordings, series timers
- **SyncPlay** — synchronized group watching sessions

### Built-in knowledge

Includes 10 reference guides the AI can consult to help with Jellyfin setup and troubleshooting — transcoding, Docker, file naming, remote access, migrating from Plex/Emby, performance tuning, and more.

### Safety controls

- **Read-only mode** — prevent all writes with `-read-only`
- **Disable destructive operations** — block deletes, restarts, and shutdowns with `-disable-destructive`
- **Toolset scoping** — expose only the tool groups you need with `-toolsets`
- **Confirmation required** — destructive operations require explicit `confirm=true`; the AI is instructed to ask the user before any write operation
- **HTTP authentication** — bearer token auth for HTTP transport

### Prompts

18 pre-built workflows like `movie-night`, `binge-watch`, `library-health`, `troubleshoot`, `duplicate-finder`, and `codec-optimize` that guide the AI through multi-step tasks. See [prompts](internal/server/prompts) for the full list.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Jellyfin API key

1. Open your Jellyfin web UI
2. Go to **Administration > Dashboard > API Keys**
3. Click **+** to create a new key
4. Give it a name (e.g., "MCP") and copy the key

### 2. Install jellyfin-mcp

| Method | Command | Requirements |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Binary | Download from [Releases](https://github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp/releases) | None |
| Go install | `go install github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest` | [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| Go run | `go run github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest` | [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| npx | `npx -y @jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp` | npm (linux/x64 only) |

<details>
<summary>Detailed instructions for each method</summary>

**Binary** — download and extract:

1. Download the archive for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp/releases)
2. Extract it: `tar xzf jellyfin-mcp_*.tar.gz` (or unzip on Windows)
3. Move the binary somewhere on your PATH: `sudo mv jellyfin-mcp /usr/local/bin/`
4. Verify: `jellyfin-mcp --help`

**Go install** — places the binary in `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `~/go/bin`). Make sure that directory is on your PATH, then verify: `jellyfin-mcp --help`

**Go run** — no install step needed. Use `go run github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest` directly in your MCP client config (see examples below).

**npx** — bundles a pre-compiled linux/x64 binary. Intended for MetaMCP and other Docker-based MCP gateways. For other platforms, use one of the methods above.

### 3. Connect to your MCP client

Pick the client you use and follow the steps below. In every example, replace the URL and API key with yours.

#### Claude Desktop

1. Open your Claude Desktop config file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add the following:

**If you installed the binary:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jellyfin": {
      "command": "jellyfin-mcp",
      "env": {
        "JELLYFIN_URL": "https://jellyfin_host:8920",
        "JELLYFIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If Claude can't find the binary, replace `"jellyfin-mcp"` with the full path (run `which jellyfin-mcp` on macOS/Linux or `where jellyfin-mcp` on Windows to find it).

**Or skip the install — run directly with Go:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jellyfin": {
      "command": "go",
      "args": ["run", "github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "JELLYFIN_URL": "https://jellyfin_host:8920",
        "JELLYFIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

#### Claude Code

```sh
# If installed:
claude mcp add \
  -e JELLYFIN_URL=https://jellyfin_host:8920 \
  -e JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  jellyfin -- jellyfin-mcp

# Or run directly with Go:
claude mcp add \
  -e JELLYFIN_URL=https://jellyfin_host:8920 \
  -e JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  jellyfin -- go run github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest
```

#### OpenCode

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `opencode.json` in your project root):

```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "jellyfin": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["jellyfin-mcp"],
      // Or run directly with Go:
      // "command": ["go", "run", "github.com/jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp@latest"],
      "environment": {
        "JELLYFIN_URL": "https://jellyfin_host:8920",
        "JELLYFIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### MetaMCP

MetaMCP runs in Docker with `npx` pre-installed. Use the npm package to run via stdio (no HTTP setup needed):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jellyfin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "JELLYFIN_URL": "https://jellyfin_host:8920",
        "JELLYFIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With CLI flags:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jellyfin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jaredtrent/jellyfin-mcp", "-read-only", "-toolsets", "discovery,media,playback"],
      "env": {
        "JELLYFIN_URL": "https://jellyfin_host:8920",
        "JELLYFIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, connect via HTTP transport:

1. Run `jellyfin-mcp` in HTTP mode on your host:

```sh
JELLYFIN_URL=https://jellyfin_host:8920 \
JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your_api_key \
jellyfin-mcp -http -http-token your_secret_token
```

2. In the MetaMCP dashboard, add a new **Streamable HTTP** server:
   - **URL**: `http://host.docker.internal:8080/mcp`
   - **Bearer Token**: `your_secret_token`

`host.docker.internal` reaches the host from inside Docker (macOS/Windows). On Linux, add `--addr 0.0.0.0:8080` and use your host's LAN IP instead of `host.docker.internal`.

## Transport

jellyfin-mcp supports two transport modes. Use whichever your MCP client requires.

| Transport | Flag | When to use |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **stdio** | *(default)* | Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and most MCP clients that launch a local process |
| **Streamable HTTP** | `-http` | MetaMCP (HTTP mode), or any client that connects to a remote URL |

**stdio** — the server communicates over stdin/stdout. The MCP client starts `jellyfin-mcp` as a subprocess and manages its lifecycle. This is the simplest setup and works with most clients.

**Streamable HTTP** — the server listens on an HTTP endpoint (`/mcp`) that supports bidirectional streaming. Use this when your MCP client can't run a local process or when you want to run the server on a different machine from the client.

```sh
# Start in HTTP mode on localhost
jellyfin-mcp -http

# Listen on all interfaces with auth (required for non-localhost)
jellyfin-mcp -http -addr 0.0.0.0:8080 -http-token your_secret_token
```

The HTTP server also exposes `/health` (returns `{"status":"ok"}`) for monitoring and load balancer health checks. Sessions time out after 30 minutes of inactivity.

## Options

### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-toolsets` | Comma-separated toolset groups to enable | all |
| `-read-only` | Only register read-only tools — no writes, deletes, or mutations | off |
| `-disable-destructive` | Skip destructive tools (delete, restart, shutdown) while allowing other writes | off |
| `-http` | Run as Streamable HTTP server instead of stdio | off |
| `-addr` | HTTP listen address | `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `-http-token` | Bearer token for HTTP authentication (required when listening on non-localhost) | none |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` | Yes | API key from your Jellyfin dashboard |
| `JELLYFIN_URL` | No | Server URL (default: `https://jellyfin_host:8920`) |
| `JELLYFIN_USER_ID` | No | User ID — auto-detected from the API key if not set |

### Toolsets

31 tools organized into 8 groups. Enable specific groups with `-toolsets discovery,media,...` to reduce context size and keep the AI focused. By default, all toolsets are enabled.

| Toolset | Tools | Covers |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `discovery` | 6 | Search, browse, recommendations, item details |
| `media` | 3 | TV shows, music, people |
| `user` | 3 | Favorites, playlists, collections |
| `playback` | 4 | Sessions, playback control, SyncPlay |
| `admin` | 8 | System, users, libraries, tasks, plugins, devices, server config |
| `content` | 4 | Metadata, subtitles, images, video versions |
| `livetv` | 2 | Channels, guide, recordings, DVR |
| `analytics` | 1 | Stats, codec reports, duplicates |

For a casual "search and play" setup, `-toolsets discovery,media,playback` is a good starting point. Add `user` for playlist/collection management or `admin` for server maintenance. See [tools](internal/server/tools) for the full list with descriptions.

### Access control examples

```sh
# Casual use — search, browse, and play only (13 read-only + playback tools)
jellyfin-mcp -toolsets discovery,media,playback

# Shared family server — allow playlists and favorites, block all admin operations
jellyfin-mcp -toolsets discovery,media,user,playback

# Full access, but protect against accidental deletes/restarts
jellyfin-mcp -disable-destructive

# Monitoring/analytics only — no writes at all
jellyfin-mcp -read-only -toolsets discovery,analytics
```

## MCP capabilities

Beyond tools, jellyfin-mcp implements several MCP protocol features that compatible clients can use.

**Resources** — 13 live data endpoints the AI can read without a tool call. These include server info, library lists, active sessions, now-playing, favorites, recently played, and more. Clients that support MCP resources can access these directly for quick lookups. See [resources](internal/server/resources) for the full list.

**Resource subscriptions** — Clients can subscribe to session and content resources for real-time change notifications. Sessions are polled every 10 seconds; content (latest additions, recently played) every 60 seconds. The server only polls when at least one subscription is active.

**Prompts** — 18 pre-built workflows the AI can invoke for multi-step tasks. See [prompts](internal/server/prompts) for the full list.

**Completions** — Prompt arguments and resource template URIs support auto-completion (e.g., genre lists, language codes, item/user/library ID lookups).

**Logging** — Tool calls emit structured MCP log notifications with timing data back to the client, in addition to stderr logging for local debugging.

## Important notes

**API key permissions** — The API key grants full access to whatever Jellyfin permissions are available. For shared or less trusted setups, pair it with `-read-only` or `-toolsets` to limit what the AI can do.

**Network exposure** — In stdio mode, the server is only accessible to the local MCP client process. In HTTP mode, use `-http-token` whenever the server is reachable beyond localhost. The server refuses to start on a non-localhost address without a token.

**Jellyfin version** — Tested against Jellyfin 10.8+ and 10.9+. Older versions may be missing some API endpoints (e.g., playback reporting, activity log queries).

**Single binary, no runtime dependencies** — jellyfin-mcp is a statically compiled Go binary. No Node.js, Python, Java, or container runtime is required. The npm package is just a delivery wrapper around the same binary.
